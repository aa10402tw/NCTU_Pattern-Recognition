# NCTU_Pattern_Recognition

There are three major part of this repository : [Classifier](#Classifier), [Embedding (dimension reduction)](#Embedding) and [Clustering](#Clustering). 

## Classifier 
In Classifier folder, we implement several classifiers from scratch (using python3).
Those classifiers includeing NaiveBayes classifier, Bayesian classifier and Peceptron classifier.
To train the classifier, we use datasets provied by [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), 
and we have implemented functions for read some datasets, includeing Iris, Glass and BreastCancer.

Completed classifiers:
- [x] NaiveBayes
- [ ] Bayesian
- [ ] Peceptron
